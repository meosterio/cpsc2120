/*I would make an array of linked lists of all the inputs read in with the head being the
names of the person, and the liked lists being the attempted passwords.
Then for testing, read in the password being tested, and find its location in the
array. Then if any of the 3 previous values are =, it is invalid. Each array name
would have a counter, and everytime the password is invalid, increment the counterby one.
